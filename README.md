# cfr-solver

Nash-equilibrium strategies for imperfect-information games, computed in OCaml
with counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). It solves Kuhn poker and Leduc
hold'em with four CFR variants (vanilla CFR, CFR+, linear CFR and discounted
CFR) and measures how far any strategy is from equilibrium with an exact best
response. Monte Carlo CFR is next.

## Example

```
$ dune exec cfr-solver -- solve -n 10000
kuhn: 10000 iterations of cfr in 0.00 s
game value      -0.055546 (player 0)
exploitability  2.318e-03

player 0
  J    p 0.792  b 0.208
  Jpb  p 1.000  b 0.000
  Q    p 1.000  b 0.000
  Qpb  p 0.449  b 0.551
  K    p 0.387  b 0.613
  Kpb  p 0.000  b 1.000

player 1
  Qp  p 1.000  b 0.000
  Qb  p 0.661  b 0.339
  Kp  p 0.000  b 1.000
  Kb  p 0.000  b 1.000
  Jp  p 0.665  b 0.335
  Jb  p 1.000  b 0.000
```

Each row is an information set: the player's card, then the moves so far
(`p` is check or fold, `b` is bet or call). So `Qpb` is player 0 holding the
queen after checking and facing a bet.

The output matches the theory. Kuhn poker has a one-parameter family of
equilibria: player 0 bluffs a jack with some probability alpha in [0, 1/3],
bets a king with 3 alpha and calls with a queen with alpha + 1/3. Here CFR
landed on alpha = 0.208, with the king bet at 0.613 (3 alpha = 0.623) and the
queen call at 0.551 (alpha + 1/3 = 0.541). Player 1's equilibrium is unique
(bluff a jack and call with a queen 1/3 of the time), and CFR gets 0.335 and
0.339. The game is worth -1/18 = -0.0556 to player 0.

`--json FILE` writes the strategy as JSON, `--trace FILE` writes
exploitability at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, ... iterations as CSV, and `-a` picks the
algorithm (`cfr`, `cfr+`, `lcfr`, `dcfr`).

## Leduc hold'em

Leduc is the standard next step after Kuhn: six cards (two each of J, Q, K),
two betting rounds with raises of 2 and 4, a public board card, and pairs
beating high cards. The rules follow OpenSpiel's `leduc_poker`. Suits never
matter, so the solver deals ranks and works with 288 infosets where OpenSpiel
has 936; the uniform policy's NashConv comes out at 4.747222, the value
OpenSpiel's tests use.

```
$ dune exec cfr-solver -- solve -g leduc -a dcfr -n 10000
leduc: 10000 iterations of dcfr(1.5,0,2) in 0.34 s
game value      -0.085606 (player 0)
exploitability  7.805e-06
```

Player 0 loses 0.0856 chips a hand at equilibrium, the value usually quoted for
Leduc. A few of the first-round decisions from that run (`c` is check or call,
`r` raise, `f` fold):

| infoset | meaning                              | f     | c     | r     |
|---------|--------------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|
| `J:`    | player 0 opens with a jack           |       | 0.928 | 0.072 |
| `K:`    | player 0 opens with a king           |       | 0.248 | 0.752 |
| `J:cr`  | player 0 checked a jack, faces a raise | 0.946 | 0.036 | 0.018 |
| `J:r`   | player 1 holds a jack, faces a raise | 0.819 | 0.126 | 0.055 |
| `K:c`   | player 1 holds a king after a check  |       | 0.000 | 1.000 |

Leduc's equilibrium is not unique, so another algorithm can land on different
mixes with the same value and exploitability.

## Convergence

`cfr-solver compare -g GAME -n N --svg FILE` runs all four variants side by
side and plots exploitability of the average strategy. The chart at the top is
Leduc. Some of the rows it prints, from runs of 100,000 iterations:

| game  | iterations | cfr      | cfr+     | lcfr     | dcfr     |
|-------|-----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Kuhn  | 100        | 2.57e-2  | 1.19e-3  | 1.09e-3  | 1.67e-3  |
| Kuhn  | 10,000     | 2.32e-3  | 9.63e-6  | 8.61e-6  | 2.39e-5  |
| Kuhn  | 100,000    | 6.76e-4  | 2.14e-6  | 8.36e-7  | 7.05e-7  |
| Leduc | 100        | 1.73e-1  | 1.34e-2  | 3.45e-2  | 7.75e-3  |
| Leduc | 10,000     | 9.85e-3  | 5.42e-6  | 1.23e-3  | 7.81e-6  |
| Leduc | 100,000    | 3.18e-3  | 4.73e-7  | 2.43e-4  | 1.10e-6  |

Vanilla CFR sits on its O(1/sqrt T) worst-case rate. After 100,000 iterations
on Leduc, CFR+ is 6,700 times less exploitable and DCFR 2,900 times. Linear
CFR, which keeps negative regrets and only reweights them, does well on Kuhn
but stalls on Leduc; Brown and Sandholm saw the same kind of game dependence
(it was poor on Goofspiel). DCFR leads on Leduc for the first few thousand
iterations, then flattens out between 5,000 and 30,000 while CFR+ passes it
near 8,000. The Kuhn chart is in [docs/kuhn.svg](docs/kuhn.svg), and the raw
curves are in `docs/*.csv`.

## Building

Needs OCaml 5.1 or newer and opam.

```
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
dune build
dune test
dune exec cfr-solver -- solve --help
```

## How it works

**Games.** A game is a module with a history type and one function,
`node : history -> history node`:

```ocaml
type 'h node =
  | Terminal of float                  (* payoff to player 0 *)
  | Chance of (float * 'h) list
  | Decision of { player : player; infoset : string; actions : (string * 'h) list }
```

Solvers are functors over this signature, so `Cfr.Make (Kuhn)` and
`Best_response.Make (Kuhn)` work for any game that follows the contract (keys
unique per player, same actions at every history of an infoset, perfect
recall). The test suite checks that contract by walking the whole tree.

**Compiled tree** (`lib/tree.ml`). `node` is lazy, so walking it rebuilds
lists and infoset-key strings on every visit. The solver builds the tree once
instead, numbers the infosets, and keeps regrets, strategy sums and the cached
strategy in flat float arrays where infoset i owns a contiguous slice. On Leduc
that took 10,000 iterations of vanilla CFR from 3.63 s to 0.17 s with the same
output to the last printed digit. `dune exec ./bench/bench.exe` measures it: about 1.9
million iterations a second on Kuhn and 61,000 on Leduc (vanilla CFR on a
Windows laptop; the alternating variants do two passes and run at half that).

**CFR** (`lib/cfr.ml`). Each iteration walks the tree once, carrying both
players' reach probabilities and chance's. At a decision it adds
`opponent reach x chance reach x (v(a) - v)` to each action's regret and the
player's own reach times the current strategy to the strategy sum. The next
strategy comes from regret matching, and the average strategy is what
converges. One detail matters: an infoset is visited once per history inside
it, so the current strategy is computed once per iteration and cached.
Recomputing it on every visit still converges at about the same speed, but it
is a different algorithm, and the exact check against OpenSpiel's two-iteration
values catches it.

**Variants.** CFR+, linear CFR and discounted CFR all fit one rule from Brown
and Sandholm's DCFR paper: at the end of iteration t, multiply positive
regrets by t^alpha / (t^alpha + 1), negative regrets by t^beta / (t^beta + 1),
and give iteration t weight t^gamma in the average strategy. Vanilla CFR is
(inf, inf, 0), CFR+ is (inf, -inf, 1), so negative regrets reset to zero every
iteration, linear CFR is (1, 1, 1) and the recommended DCFR is (1.5, 0, 2). The
solver implements that rule once, and the variants are just parameters plus
one switch: all except vanilla update the players alternately, player 1 on
each iteration playing against player 0's freshly updated strategy. That
switch matters. CFR+ with simultaneous updates fails OpenSpiel's CFR+
convergence test.

**Best response** (`lib/best_response.ml`). The responder has to pick one
action per infoset without seeing the opponent's card. So the solver first
gathers every history in each of the responder's infosets with its weight
(chance times opponent reach), then picks the action with the highest weighted
sum, deciding deeper infosets first through memoized recursion. Exploitability
is half the sum of the two best-response values (the convention OpenSpiel
uses), and it is zero exactly at an equilibrium.

## Testing

The tests check against numbers that come from outside this code:

- OpenSpiel's published values: NashConv of the uniform policy is 11/12, of
  always-pass is 2, and of every member of the equilibrium family is 0. The
  best-response actions against uniform match theirs, including an exact tie
  (a king is worth 1.5 either way). After two CFR iterations the average
  strategy at `Qb` is exactly [1/4, 3/4].
- A property test (qcheck, 300 random profiles): the best response equals the
  maximum over all 64 pure strategies, enumerated by brute force, and playing
  it earns exactly that value.
- Payoffs and game values derived by hand, including -1/18 for the
  equilibrium family at several values of alpha.
- Regret matching on rock-paper-scissors converges to uniform in self-play.
- Leduc: OpenSpiel's NashConv of 4.747222 for the uniform policy and 2 for
  always taking the first action, hand-counted tree sizes, and payoffs worked
  out by hand (raise-fold, re-raise-fold, a pair beating a king, a split pot,
  the 13-chip maximum pot).
- Every CFR variant against a slow reference implementation in
  `test/reference_cfr.ml`, written separately: it enumerates histories with
  their reach probabilities instead of carrying them in one walk, evaluates
  every child with its own expected-value pass, and restates the DCFR weights
  from the paper. After 30 iterations on Kuhn the average strategies agree to
  1e-10, for the four named variants and for 20 random (alpha, beta, gamma).
- CFR+ meets OpenSpiel's own CFR+ test (value within 1e-3 and exploitability
  under 1e-3 after 200 Kuhn iterations), and gets Leduc's value to 1e-4 in 500.

Hand-made bugs get caught: a best response that decides from a single history,
a CFR without the strategy cache, an average weighted by t + 1 instead of t, a
discount applied with the previous iteration's t, and CFR+ with simultaneous
updates each fail at least two tests.
